# Stock Analysis 

## Overview

### The purpose of the Project

- The purpose of the project is to analyze stock market performance over the last few years for Steve to help his parents make sound investment decisions.
- Another objective is to refactor VBA code and measure performance of the refactored code through runtimes.

## Results 

### VBA Code and Workbook

- The VBA Code to analyze stock performance and runtime for the year entered by the user can be found in the link [VBA_challenge.vbs](https://github.com/manasidek/stock_analysis/blob/main/VBA_challenge.vbs)

- The workbook containing the above VBA code and showing the stock performance for the selected year is in the .xlsm file [VBA_challenge.xlsm](https://github.com/manasidek/stock_analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm)

### Stock performance and execution time for 2017

## Summary

### Advantages of Refactoring Code
- Refactoring can make the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read 

### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
- If refactoring is not done properly then it may introduce new bugs and errors into the code.
- Refactoring can be time comsuming if the code is long and complicated.

### Pros of the refactored VBA script
- The refactored code will run perfectly well for other years as well without affecting the performance significatly for the same stocks.

### Cons of the recatored VBA script
- If more stocks are introduced in the dataset, it will require only a change in the code to include those additional stocks in the 'tickers' array.
